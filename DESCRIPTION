Description: Using a variety of tools, this package seeks to annotate cells from one dataset with
    cell labels from another experiment.  Currently two major methods are included.  UMAP projection, which
    projects cells onto a reference atlas using the umap transform function and annotates the cells according
    to the nearest neighbor in the reference.  The second group of methods use transfer learning algorithms built with
    the ArrayFire C++ library to annotate cells using an atlas.
